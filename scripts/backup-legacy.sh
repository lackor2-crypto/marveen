# that build output is missing, so a broken build never stops backups.

# The archive has two top-level groups so a restore is unambiguous about
# where each file belongs (see docs/MIGRATION.md):
#
#   repo/   -> extract under the project root (this repo)

#                               virtualenvs, browser profile and logs)
#     .env                     (project root secrets)
#     scheduled-tasks.json     (legacy, if present)
#     assets/meetings/**       (meeting transcripts/memos)
#     agents/*/CLAUDE.md, SOUL.md, .mcp.json, agent-config.json
#     agents/*/memory/**         (the agent's own memory index + entries)
#     agents/*/.claude/channels/{telegram,slack,discord}/.env, access.json
#
#   home/   -> extract under $HOME
#     .claude/skills/**            (the self-built skill library)
#     .claude/scheduled-tasks/**   (file-based scheduled tasks: SKILL.md + config)
#     .claude/channels/*/.env      (MAIN orchestrator channel token)
#     .claude/channels/*/access.json, invites.json, approved/**  (pairing state)
